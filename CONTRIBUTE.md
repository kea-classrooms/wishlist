# CONTRIBUTE

### How to get started
To contribute you should be part of the team '_Et-eller-andet-diskret_' on GitHub, as this will give you admin rights.
We have a project set up where you can see and create issues.

To work on the project you should create a _new_ branch pr. issue, and check it out in your IDE (we use IntelliJ).
We follow the naming conventions you can see under the __naming conventions__ section.

To follow the progress of the current issues that need to be worked on and update your progress on those.
Please take a look at the GitHub Scrumboard.

### Naming conventions
Our naming convention follows the pattern: `category/issue-reference/description`.
If you wanted to work on the issue '_issue#1: create foo_', your branch should be called:
`feature/issue-1/foo`.




### Pushing to branch and pull requests

...
There are several steps that needs to be followed, to insure a more efficient and smooth sailing of the project.
To merge your finished work from your branch, a pull request must be issued and looked through by the team.
In this section we prioritize keeping merge conflicts and breaking of code to a minimum.
The way we will be tackling this issue, is by running smoke tests and unit tests between every merge.
